Welcome to **Atomic Gains** — the tiniest, most absurd fitness tracker in the universe.
This app takes the smallest actions you do (like breathing, blinking, or walking to the fridge)
and turns them into scientifically ridiculous *atom-based fitness gains*.

🌐 **Live App**: [Launch Atomic Gains](https://atomicgains-qd6fdgiuorlb9ulpcnepbf.streamlit.app/)

## 🧬 What It Does
- You input a microscopic effort (e.g., "I blinked", "I did one squat")
- The app returns a silly atomic-level gain (e.g., "You’ve gained 2,500 atoms of eye stamina")
- It tracks your **total atoms earned** and gives you a **rank**:
  - 🫧 Nano Newbie
  - 🌋 Molecule Mover
  - 🔌 Subatomic Beast

Includes:
- 🎉 Balloons & fun facts
- 🔐 Hidden easter eggs (try typing “universe”...)
- 🧠 Action log for your last 10 achievements
